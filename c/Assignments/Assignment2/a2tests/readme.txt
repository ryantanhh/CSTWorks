Note that all files are in Unix format.  

The output files out01 - out30 were generated by the following commands:

./concat -e data1 > out01
./concat -b data1 > out02
./concat -n data1 > out03
./concat -s -n data1 > out04
./concat -s -b data1 > out05
./concat -s -e -n  < data1 > out06
./concat -e data2 > out07
./concat -s -e data2 > out08
./concat -b -e data2 > out09
./concat -t data2 > out10
./concat -n data2 data1 > out11
./concat -s -e  data1 data2 > out12
./concat -n data3 data4 > out13
./concat -n -t data3 data4 > out14
./concat -e data3 data4 > out15
./concat -b data3 data4 > out16
./concat -s data3 data4 > out17
./concat -s -e data3 data4 > out18
./concat -s -e -n data4 data3 > out19
./concat -s -e -b data4 data3 > out20
./concat -b -n data3 > out21
./concat -n -b data3 > out22
./concat < data3 > out23 
./concat -n -s < data3 > out24
./concat -b -s < data3 > out25
./concat -- -h > out26
./concat -n -- -h > out27
./concat -b -h data3 > out28
./concat -x -h 2> out29
./concat -help 2> out30

Note that your output for out28, out29 & out30 may differ from mine
because my version doesn't hard code the program name. E.g., my version has

./concat: invalid option -- x
Try './concat -h' for more information.

because the program was invoked as ./concat ...

NOTE: You may be able to run the tests using the 'runtests' script.  
Put your executable, which must be named concat.exe (in cygwin), in this 
directory.  Then in the cygwin bash shell, type: 
./runtests
